# 🎶 Spotify Embed Gallary (CI/CD Experiment)

This project is a **Spotify Embed Gallery** powered by GitHub Actions and Spotify’s oEmbed API.  
Contributors can add their favorite **tracks** or **artists**, and the site will automatically update with playable Spotify embeds.

✨ This experiment demonstrates how GitHub Actions can automate content generation and deployment, turning a simple repo into a collaborative music project.
